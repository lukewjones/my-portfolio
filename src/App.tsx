              <br />
              I learned SWE from the Frontend Developer Career Path on Scrimba.com which helped me become very familiar with
              HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, as well as many other concepts essential to software engineering.

              Away from the screen, I'm a people person who loves concerts, photography, movies,
               meeting new people and building friendships with anyone and everyone.
